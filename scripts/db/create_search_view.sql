--  Create a tree_search view
--    This view is used by geoserver to run cql queries from the search page.
--    Fields not included in the advanced filters may be removed. Check the views code 
--    to make sure a field does not help resolve some other fileter before removing.
--
--    Stewardship date columns may need to be altered if the choices for stewardship
--    fields are changed. 
--
--    Add this view as a layer to geoserver and use it as the GEOSERVER_GEO_LAYER setting
